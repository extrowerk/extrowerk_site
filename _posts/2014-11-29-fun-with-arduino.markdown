I just bought my first Arduino board!
You'll get the microcontroller in a small card-box without any documentation, but it is not a big deal. (and hey, it costs just â‚¬24,99!)

For the science and justice I bought a mid-sized breadboard, a PSU (3-12V), some cables, resistors and LEDs... If you doesn't have micro-USB cable, don't forget to grab one too.

### Nice, but... Whattahell is this thing?

*The Arduino Micro is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4. It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro USB cable to get started. It has a form factor that enables it to be easily placed on a breadboard.*

### Cool, but can it make me a coffee?

Technically if you can draw an flowchart about the coffee-making process, then sure. Lemme' hear about your Arduino coffee machine!

### How it works?

The whole process is really straightforward and intuitive.

You can get the whole IDE (Development Environment) for free at the [Arduino website](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software). Through an easy install process (Java required) you'll get everything what required for your smartCoffeeMachine.

As the Arduino board sports micro-USB header no PIC-flasher required. It will show up as a USB serial port in your OS.

The IDE comes with many example program and as your Arduino have on-board LED, you can test your new toy without any big investment. So i made a really complex connection: a blinkin' LED on my breadboard. **Awesome!**

As expected from a microcontroller, you cannot sing or dance what do you want,  so get all of your C-programming skills, 'cause you'll need to program this thing to get the expected results. But don't panic: as you can see [here](http://arduino.cc/en/tutorial/blink) the tutorials are nice written, easy to understand. I'm sure it cannot make problem for a 8 years old to follow the tutorials and the result is guaranteed. Great things!
