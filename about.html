<p>Hi and welcome, my name is Zoltán Mizsei.</p>

<p>Currently I have more than 8 years of CAD experience behind me and I have obtained significant expertise in the area of CATIA automation.</p>

<p>Presently I am working in the Stuttgart-based office of EK Design AG. as development engineer, where I am able to save lot of time and energy by know-how recycling and parametric modelling methods, furthermore with macros, scripts and PDM-friendly solutions. I am keen on elaborating motion simulation, depending on the situation in DMU kinematic module or “skeleton” based. In my work I always aspire for clear, tidy, transparent and logic model construction; I am open to new ideas and I am constantly in the search of new and more effective solutions.</p>

<p>I often derive advantage of my expertise collected due to my far-flung scope of interest; I am pleased to face tasks full of challenges whereby I need to utilise my geometric, IT knowledge, problem-solving skills and logic for achieving the desired goal. As a result of my IT-related interest and hobbies I can easily get good understanding of new trends and technologies and I can integrate them with ease into my work 	processes. In the last years I had the opportunity to gain experience in writing educational materials and training of peers and to develop my manager skills through team management and work process planning.</p>

<p>Due to my personal interest and work I continuously maintain international relations, and I enjoy myself and feel confident in a multicultural environment. I am an open and friendly person; I am pleased to see that as a result of my cooperation/support something new and amazing is created.</p>

<p>Even though currently my work is related to the motor industry, in my free-time I am keen on writing code for microcontrollers, administering websites and translating books.</p>
